Thanks for sharing! It seems like the project is structured as a monolithic application, where the code is organized by domain instead of by technical layer.

Under the payment domain, there are several Kotlin files:

TransactionService.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of business logic related to payment transactions.
PaymentService.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of business logic related to payments, such as creating, updating, and marking payments as succeeded or failed.
PaymentEventCmdHandler.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of command handlers for payment events, which receive commands and execute them to produce events.
PaymentEventListener.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of event listeners for payment events, which receive events and perform actions in response to them.
PaymentEventPublisher.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a publisher for payment events, which publishes events to a message queue or event stream.
aws/PaymentCmdDdbRepository.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a repository for payment commands, which persists commands to a DynamoDB table.
aws/PaymentEventDdbRepository.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a repository for payment events, which persists events to a DynamoDB table.
http/v1/PaymentController.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a REST API endpoint for creating payments.
Under the stripe domain, there are several Kotlin files:

StripeClient.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a client for interacting with the Stripe API.
StripeService.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of business logic related to Stripe, such as creating Stripe customers or charging Stripe cards.
StripeEvent.kt: This file likely contains the definition of Stripe events that the application can receive and handle.
StripeDomain.kt: This file likely contains the definition of domain models for Stripe entities such as customers or charges.
http/v1/StripeController.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a REST API endpoint for creating Stripe customers or charging Stripe cards.
aws/StripeEventDdbRepository.kt: This file likely contains the implementation of a repository for Stripe events, which persists events to a DynamoDB table.
Overall, this structure suggests that the application is using a microservices-like architecture, where each domain has its own set of components responsible for handling business logic, persistence, and external interactions.

This set of files appears to be related to the payment functionality of an application. The TransactionService.kt file contains data classes and an interface related to payment transactions. The PaymentEventListener.kt file contains an interface and implementation for handling payment events. The PaymentService.kt file contains an interface and implementation for payment-related functionality, including creating payments and handling payment events. The Stripe directory contains files related to the Stripe payment service, including a client, service, and controller. The http and aws directories within both the payment and Stripe directories appear to contain code related to HTTP and AWS functionality, respectively.

PaymentEventCmdHandler.kt: This file defines an interface PaymentEventCmdHandler and a data class ExternalTransactionUpdatedEvent, which is published by the payment gateway (stripe) when a transaction is updated.

PaymentEventPublisher.kt: This file implements the PaymentEventPublisher interface and PaymentEventCmdHandler interface. It contains a PaymentEventPublisherImpl class that is responsible for publishing PaymentEvents. The PaymentEventPublisherImpl class receives an ApplicationEventPublisher as a constructor argument and uses it to publish the events. It also implements the handle function of the PaymentEventCmdHandler interface, which is responsible for handling ExternalTransactionUpdatedEvent.

PaymentController.kt: This file defines a REST controller named PaymentController, which is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to payments. It contains a startPayment function that handles POST requests to /start.rpc and starts a payment. The startPayment function receives a StartPaymentReq object in the request body and returns a StartPaymentRes object in the response body.

PaymentCmdDdbRepository.kt: This file defines a DynamoDB repository named PaymentCmdDdbRepository that is responsible for storing PaymentCmd objects. It contains a PaymentCmdDdbEntity data class that represents a PaymentCmd object in the DynamoDB table. The PaymentCmdDdbRepository class implements the PaymentCmdRepository interface and provides functions for inserting PaymentCmd objects into the DynamoDB table.

The first code snippet is a Kotlin file containing a data class and a repository class for a payment event entity in DynamoDB. The data class is named PaymentEventDdbEntity and is annotated with @DynamoDbBean. It contains properties for the payment ID, payment event ID, flow ID, type, the ID of the command that triggered the event, the timestamp when the event was triggered, the order ID associated with the payment, and two JSON objects for the patch and snapshot. The repository class is named PaymentEventDdbRepository and implements the PaymentEventRepository interface. It provides methods for inserting and retrieving payment events from DynamoDB.

The second code snippet is a Kotlin file containing an interface and a class for interacting with the Stripe API. The interface is named StripeClient and defines methods for creating and retrieving payment intents and charges, as well as constructing webhook events from payload and signature strings. The class that implements the StripeClient interface is named StripeClientImpl and uses the Stripe Java library to make API requests. It also takes in a StripeSignatureVerifier to verify webhook signatures.

This is a Kotlin code for a Stripe service that provides functionality to handle webhooks and create payment transactions. The code has the following major components:

StripeEventId: A class that represents a Stripe event ID and implements the EventId interface.
StripeEvent: A data class that represents a Stripe event and has id, type, created, dataObjectId, and rawJson properties.
StripeEventRepository: An interface that defines a method to insert a StripeEvent.
StripeService: An interface that extends the TransactionService interface and defines a method to handle a webhook event.
StripeServiceImpl: A class that implements the StripeService interface and provides functionality to handle webhooks and create payment transactions.
The StripeEventId and StripeEvent classes are used to represent Stripe events and their IDs. The StripeEventRepository interface defines a method to insert a StripeEvent. The StripeService interface extends the TransactionService interface and defines a method to handle a webhook event. The StripeServiceImpl class implements the StripeService interface and provides functionality to handle webhooks and create payment transactions.
